The File gives you are brief overview of the AEH sample in this repository.

There are three projects the master hub, the client stub and a sample service 

The Dummy Service has the client stub as a dependency jar.

The Central Stub is acts as the dummy version of the AEH central server.

To start with run both the server and the service in tomcat.

Try accessing in the page -> localhost:8080/EmployeeDataServie/Login.jsp

It will guide you to a page where you have a text box to enter your name and an access button

once you click the access button it tries to access the service private resource

But Since the user is authenticated it redirects to a login Page -> The Login Page where the user email and password needs to be entered.

Once it is authenticated and authorized it will load back to init page where the user is asked to click the access button again

This time he will be authorized to the resource and after wards the resource page will be loaded
